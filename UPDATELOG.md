## v0.2.3

Improvements

- Unified update checking and viewer: new `update-check` service based on Tauri Updater; update badge and auto-open once per version; progress bar and "Go to Release Page" in viewer; install blocked on "Break Change".
- New floating Update Dev Panel (dev only): trigger mock updates, badge-only mode, revalidate, open viewer; position/visibility persisted per session.
- System Info card: shows last update check and can manually trigger a check using the new updater.

TypeScript & Web-only Safety

- Centralized typed Tauri env helpers (`src/utils/tauri-env.ts`) with typed stubs for web:dev.
- Hardened `use-listen` and `useZoomControls` to guard Tauri API calls in web mode; project passes strict `tsc --noEmit`.

Tauri/Rust Stability

- More robust UI readiness and notification queue; deduplicated deep links; safer window recreation and tray initialization.

Localization

- Updated strings in ar, de, es, fa, id, jp, ko, tr, tt, zh, zhtw.

CI/Release

- Stable asset names, version verification, and manual notes template retained.
- Updater artifacts enabled; bump version to 0.2.3.

## v0.2.2
- fixed bug in proxy groups menu
- added message about global mode enabled on main screen
- fixed minor bugs
- updated Mihomo core to v1.19.14

Fixes

- Windows installer: terminate new `out-mihomo(.exe)` and `out-mihomo-alpha(.exe)` processes before copying files to avoid "cannot open file" errors during upgrade.

CI/Release

- Bump release version to 0.2.2.

---

## v0.2.1

New

- Version sync and verification: added `sync-version` and `verify-version` scripts. Versions in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` are auto-synced from `package.json` before builds (locally and in CI) and verified for consistency.

Fixes

- Linux (Ubuntu) linking in CI: install `build-essential`, `pkg-config`, and `libc6-dev` to fix missing CRT objects (`Scrt1.o`, `crti.o`, etc.).

CI/Release

- Unified release uploads to always use the `package.json` version (single source of truth) across all jobs.
- Added sync + verify steps to dev/release/alpha workflows for early detection of version drift.
- Consistent Windows artifact renaming based on the unified version.

Known limitations

- macOS builds remain disabled.

## v0.2.0

New

- Home: added a quick “Switch to …” button to toggle between System Proxy and TUN.

Fixes

- RU locale: removed duplicate keys and refined wording.

CI/Release

- Update manifests (including Fixed WebView2) are generated for matching tags.

Known limitations

- macOS builds remain disabled.
